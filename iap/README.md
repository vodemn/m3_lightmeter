### Equipment profiles

Each equipment profile allows you to select:

- Aperture values and shutter speeds, that your lens and camera have
- ND filters, that fit the chosen lens
- ISO values, that your camera supports

Creating multiple profiles for different cameras and lenses allows you to easily switch between them and always have the relevant readings.

### Films in use

Select the films that you usually use. Selecting one will apply a correction to shutter speeds greater than 1" to compensate for the reciprocity failure.
