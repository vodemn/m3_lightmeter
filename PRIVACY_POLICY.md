# Privacy Policy

I, Vadim Turko, built the Material Lightmeter app as a Free app with optional Pro functionality available via in-app purchase. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

## Information Collection and Use

The app does **not collect any personal data** such as names, email addresses, or location.

App settings, including theme preferences, calibration values, and other local preferences, are stored on the userâ€™s device and are never transmitted.

## Log Data

In the event of a crash or unexpected error, the app collects anonymous crash logs via third-party services (such as Firebase Crashlytics). These logs may include:

- Device model and operating system version  
- App configuration and usage context  
- Date and time of the crash  
- Diagnostic data relevant to the crash

This data helps improve app stability and does not include personal information.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses several Firebase services, including:

- **Firebase Crashlytics** to collect crash logs.
- **Firebase Remote Config** to deliver dynamic app settings and feature flags.
- **Firebase Storage** to store anonymous purchase-related metadata.

These services may process technical data but do **not collect or transmit personal data**. For more information, see Firebaseâ€™s [Privacy and Security](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) documentation.

## Open Source Components

Parts of the app are open-source and available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/vodemn). This includes non-commercial components of the app's source code.

## Links to Other Sites

This app may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., GitHub). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. These external sites are not operated by me, and I strongly advise you to review their privacy policies.
